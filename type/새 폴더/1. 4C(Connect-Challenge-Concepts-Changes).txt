A THINKING ROUTINE FROM PROJECT ZERO, HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION

The 4 C’s
A routine for structuring a text-based discussion.

Connections:		  What connections do you draw between the text and your 			 
			   own life or your other learning?

Challenge:		  What ideas, positions, or assumptions do you want to challenge or 		
			   argue with in the text?

Concepts:		  What key concepts or ideas do you think are important and worth 		
			   holding on to from the text?

Changes:		  What changes in attitudes, thinking, or action are suggested by the 		
			   text, either for you or others?

Purpose: What kind of thinking does this routine encourage?
The routine provides learners with a structure for a text-based discussion built around making connections, 
asking questions, identifying key ideas, and considering application.

Application: When and where can I use it?
After reading a text, or even several different but related texts, small groups can use this rou-tine to discuss 
the text and explore the application of ideas.  The individual questions for each of  the  C’s  may  be  adjusted 
to  fit  the  needs  of  the  group  and  the  text  being  read.    Sometimes you may want to focus on a just 2 
or 3 C’s rather than all 4.

Launch: What are some tips for starting and using this routine?
This routine works best with small groups.  Before beginning discussion, give group members time to 
identify passages from the text that correspond to eachof the C’s.  These should be un-derlined  or  in  
some  way  identified  so  that  they  can  later  be  shared  with  the  group.    In  the group, discussion 
begins by one person sharing a connection that he or she made, reading the text passage and explaining the 
connection.  Members of the group may add their comments on the offered passage.  The next member of 
the group then shares his or her passage and the dis-cussion continues in the matter until easch member has 
shared a “connection.”  The group then moves on to the next “C,” always making sure that the chosen text 
passage is first shared and then discussed.  You may have groups record the text passages to document the 
discussions.
