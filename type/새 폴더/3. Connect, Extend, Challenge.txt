A THINKING ROUTINE FROM PROJECT ZERO, HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION

Connect, Extend, Challenge

Consider what you have just read, seen, or heard, and then ask yourself:  

•	 How are the ideas and information connected to what you already know?  

•	 What new ideas did you get that broadened your thinking or extended it in different  
directions?  

•	 What challenges or puzzles emerge for you?

Purpose: What kind of thinking does this routine encourage?
This routine helps students connect new ideas to those they know and encourages them to reflect upon 
how they have extended their thinking as a result of what they are learning about or experiencing. 

Application: When and where can I use it?
Use this routine when you want students to make explicit connections to something previously learned or 
experienced. Since it is designed to help students process new information actively, it works well as the 
conclusion to lessons in which students have been reading, watching videos, or otherwise taking in new 
information. Another approach is to use the routine to close the discussion of a topic or unit of study in 
order to help students synthesize the information. Some questions you might consider in your planning:  
Are there connections to be made between this content and what students already know? Will students be 
engaging with new information that they might find challenging?  

Launch: What are some tips for starting and using this routine?
This routine works well with the whole class, in small groups, or individually. If you are using it in a group 
discussion, ask students to share their thoughts. As you process each step of the routine, document their 
comments either in a public space for all to see or in your own notes. If students are working individually, 
they could document their responses in a journal or in a way that can be displayed in class.
